  <title>Count the Number of Consistent Strings</title>

// You are given a string allowed consisting of distinct characters and an array of strings words. A string is consistent if all characters in the string appear in the string allowed.
// Return the number of consistent strings in the array words.

// Input: 
// allowed = "ab"
// words = ["ad","bd","aaab","baa","badab"]
// Output: 2
// Explanation: Strings "aaab" and "baa" are consistent since they only contain characters 'a' and 'b'.

// spread allowed string
// spread the words array and then spread it again so that it is the same level of spread as allowed array (individual characters)
// Look at the spread words array (spread) and iterate through each value to compare it with the value of index 0 of allowed array
// if any value in the spread array does not match to the values in allowed array, do nothing 
// if match then increase counter by 1



// which combination of letters in the words array have the letters found in the allowed array. 
// return all the elements with consisting of the letters from allowed array 



// Notes 
// spread the allowed string in order to use each character separately
// a,b 
// spread the words array in order to use each character of each element 
// a, d, b, d, a, a, a, b
// iterate through the spreadWords array to spread each element into individual characters 

// iterate through the spreaded words array (spread) 
// filter the spread array to see if it does not match with spreadAllowed array 
// ad, bd, aaab
// if not a match, return all the words that contain the match.
// aaab



allowed = "ab"
words = ["ad","bd","aaab","baa","badab"]
