  <title>Richest Customer Wealth</title>

  // You are given an m x n integer grid accounts where accounts[i][j] is the amount of money the i​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​ customer has in the j​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​ bank. Return the wealth that the richest customer has.

  // A customer's wealth is the amount of money they have in all their bank accounts. The richest customer is the customer that has the maximum wealth.

// Input: 
accounts = [[1,2,3],[3,2,1]]
// Output: 6
// Explanation:
  // 1st customer has wealth = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
  // 2nd customer has wealth = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6
  // Both customers are considered the richest with a wealth of 6 each, so return 6.

// NOTES: 
// 1. Iterate through the object to determine how many arrays are present, which is the number of customers that we need to compare.
// 2. Iterate through each array (each customer) to get the sum of their accounts (each element of their array).
// 3. Push these sums into a new array. 
// 4. Iterate through the new array to return the largest value as the output (richest customer)

  let maximumWealth = function(accounts) {
    let sumOfAccounts = []

      for (let i = 0; i < accounts.length; i++) {
        sumOfAccounts.push(accounts[i].reduce((val, acc) => acc + val));
      }
        return Math.max(...sumOfAccounts);
      
  };
  console.log(maximumWealth(accounts));
