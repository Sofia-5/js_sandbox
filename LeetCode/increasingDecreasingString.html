    //The problem
//Given a string s. You should re-order the string using the following algorithm:

// Pick the smallest character from s and append it to the result.
// Pick the smallest character from s which is greater than the last appended character to the result and append it.
// Repeat step 2 until you cannot pick more characters.
// Pick the largest character from s and append it to the result.
// Pick the largest character from s which is smaller than the last appended character to the result and append it.
// Repeat step 5 until you cannot pick more characters.
// Repeat the steps from 1 to 6 until you pick all characters from s.
// In each step, If the smallest or the largest character appears more than once you can choose any occurrence and append it to the result.
// Return the result string after sorting s with this algorithm.

// Example 1:
// Input: s = "aaaabbbbcccc"
// Output: "abccbaabccba"
// Explanation: After steps 1, 2 and 3 of the first iteration, result = "abc"
// After steps 4, 5 and 6 of the first iteration, result = "abccba"
// First iteration is done. Now s = "aabbcc" and we go back to step 1
// After steps 1, 2 and 3 of the second iteration, result = "abccbaabc"
// After steps 4, 5 and 6 of the second iteration, result = "abccbaabccba"

//STEPS: 
//1. Iterate through the array and sort the letters from smallest to greatest, but without duplicates. 
//2. Store the unique acending sorted letters in a variable.
//3. Iterate through the array again and sort the letters from largest to smallest, but without duplicates. 
// descending order
animals.sort(function (a, b) {
    if (a > b) {
        return -1;
    }
    if (b > a) {
        return 1;
    }
    return 0;
});
console.log(animals);
// ["elephant", "dog", "cat", "bee", "ant"]
